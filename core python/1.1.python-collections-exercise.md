10 exercises designed to test your mastery of the Python Collections (Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries)
### Exercise 1: List Manipulation & Slicing (The List Manager)

**Topic:** Lists (Ordered & Mutable)
**Task:** 1. Create a list called `gadgets` containing: `"Phone"`, `"Laptop"`, `"Tablet"`, `"Watch"`.
2. Append `"Camera"` to the end.
3. Insert `"Headphones"` at the second position (index 1).
4. Remove `"Tablet"` using its name.
5. Print the last two items using negative slicing.
6. Reverse the entire list using a slice.

### Exercise 2: Tuple Unpacking & Immutability (The GPS Coordinator)

**Topic:** Tuples (Ordered & Immutable)
**Task:**

1. Create a tuple named `location` with values: `40.7128`, `-74.0060`, and `"New York"`.
2. Try to change the city name to `"Brooklyn"` and observe the error. Write a comment explaining why it fails.
3. Unpack the tuple into three variables: `lat`, `lon`, and `city_name`.
4. Create a list of tuples representing three points: `(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)`. Access the y-coordinate of the second point.

### Exercise 3: Set Logic & Uniqueness (The Guest List)

**Topic:** Sets (Unique & Unordered)
**Task:**

1. You have two lists of email invites:
`list_a = ["abc@test.com", "xyz@test.com", "abc@test.com"]`
`list_b = ["xyz@test.com", "123@test.com"]`
2. Use a set to create a list of unique emails from `list_a`.
3. Find the emails that appear in **both** `list_a` and `list_b` (Intersection).
4. Find the emails that are in `list_a` but **not** in `list_b` (Difference).
5. Combine both lists into a single set of all unique guests.

### Exercise 4: Dictionary Mapping (The Inventory)

**Topic:** Dictionaries (Key-Value Pairs)
**Task:**

1. Create a dictionary `stock` where keys are item names and values are quantities: `"Apples": 50, "Bananas": 20, "Oranges": 35`.
2. Increase the number of `"Bananas"` by 15.
3. Add a new item `"Grapes"` with a value of 100.
4. Use the `.get()` method to check the stock of `"Pears"`. If it doesn't exist, return `0`.
5. Loop through the dictionary and print each item and its quantity in the format: `Item: [name] | Stock: [qty]`.

### Exercise 5: Type Casting - The Deduplicator

**Topic:** List to Set Conversion
**Task:**

1. You are given a list with many duplicate IDs: `ids = [101, 102, 101, 103, 104, 102, 105]`.
2. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
3. Convert it back to a list so it can be sorted.
4. Sort the final list in descending order.

### Exercise 6: Type Casting - Row to Record

**Topic:** Tuple to Dictionary Conversion
**Task:**

1. You have a list of tuples representing database rows: `data = [("id", 1), ("name", "Alice"), ("role", "Admin")]`.
2. Convert this list of tuples into a single dictionary called `user_profile` using a single built-in function.
3. Add a new key `"status"` with the value `"Active"`.

### Exercise 7: Logic - Choosing the Right Collection

**Topic:** Best Practices & Selection
**Scenario:** For each of the following needs, name the collection type (`List`, `Tuple`, `Set`, or `Dict`) you would use and **why**:

1. Storing a user's password and username for quick lookup.
2. Storing the fixed coordinates of the North Pole.
3. Storing a history of web pages visited (order matters, duplicates allowed).
4. Storing a collection of tags for a blog post where no tag should be repeated and order doesn't matter.

### Exercise 8: Nested Collections (The Gradebook)

**Topic:** Real-World Use Case (Nested Dicts/Lists)
**Task:**

1. Create a dictionary `classroom`.
2. The keys should be student names. The values should be another dictionary containing `"math"` and `"science"` scores.
3. Add "John" with math: 90, science: 85.
4. Add "Emily" with math: 95, science: 92.
5. Print Emily's science grade by accessing the nested dictionary.

### Exercise 9: Membership Testing (Speed Check)

**Topic:** Performance Patterns
**Task:**

1. Create a large list `big_list` containing numbers 1 to 1,000,000.
2. Create a set `big_set` from that same list.
3. Write a snippet to check if the number `999999` is in the list.
4. Write a snippet to check if the number `999999` is in the set.
5. *Knowledge Question:* Which check is faster and why? (Refer to the "When to Use" section of your guide).

### Exercise 10: The Master Transformation

**Topic:** Complex Conversion & Operations
**Task:**

1. Start with this string: `text = "apple banana apple cherry cherry cherry banana"`.
2. Split the string into a list of words.
3. Create a dictionary that counts the occurrence of each word (e.g., `{"apple": 2, ...}`).
4. Convert the keys of that dictionary into a **Tuple** named `unique_fruits`.
5. Print the fruit that appeared the most times using the dictionary.
